# Gorth
Like forth but in go hence (g)orth ;) and slower too.

It does not compile to native code it gets compiled to gxml which is basically xml with Q's in it.

It is very bare minimum right now.

Check examples for examples of the language

## How to run
./gorth com examples/test.gorth
./gorth run out.gxml
